# 🌟 Project Overview & Purpose – Python Mastery 2026

**This repository is my 6-month intensive Python bootcamp** in preparation for the **University of Texas at Austin Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (online MSAI)**.

### What This Project Is
- Structured curriculum from basics to ML-ready
- Heavily commented lessons with self-tests
- Codeup-style assessments with automated tests
- Daily commits for contribution streak
- Capstone: Personal Health & Finance Tracker Dashboard (for families managing chronic illness)

### My Why
Retired USAF IT specialist and Codeup graduate pivoting to data science/AI.  
My wife lives with relapsing-remitting MS.  
**Goal**: Land a $150k+ role so she can retire from her job and focus on health. To be able to afford health associated cost.

Every line of code, every commit, every lesson is a step toward that future.

### Hope for Others
If you're:
- A veteran transitioning to tech
- Preparing for a master's in AI/ML
- Self-studying Python with discipline
- Motivated by family or personal growth

...then this repo is for you too.  
Use it, fork it, improve it. Let's build better futures together.

**"One commit at a time."** 🚀
