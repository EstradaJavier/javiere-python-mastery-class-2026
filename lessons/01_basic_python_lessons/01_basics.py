# Python Mastery 2026 - Lesson 1: Python Basics and Foundations
# ===================================
#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE
# --------------------
# This lesson introduces beginner-level Python basics:
# - Printing output
# - Comments
# - Variables
# - Data types
# - Basic math
# - Strings and f-strings
# - Boolean values
# - Simple functions
# - User profile data
# - Age calculation from date of birth
# - Basic testing with assert
# - Using if statements
# - Type conversion
# - Lists and loops
#
# EXPECTED RESULT WHEN YOU RUN THIS FILE
# --------------------------------------
# The program will:
# 1. Print an introduction.
# 2. Build a small personal profile.
# 3. Calculate age from date of birth.
# 4. Display data types for several values.
# 5. Run simple math and string examples.
# 6. Show beginner-friendly examples of lists and conditionals.
# 7. Run a few self-tests.
# 8. Print a completion message.
#
# BEST PRACTICE NOTES
# -------------------
# - Keep code readable.
# - Use 4 spaces for indentation.
# - Use clear variable names.
# - Add comments to explain WHY something matters, not just WHAT it says.
# - Use functions to break a large problem into smaller pieces.
# - Test simple ideas often.
#
# VISUAL LEARNER TIP
# ------------------
# Think of this file like a lesson broken into blocks:
# Intro -> Profile -> Data Types -> Strings -> Math -> Decisions -> Tests
# You can collapse and expand functions in IntelliJ to study one block at a time.

# INTELLIJ HELP FOR BEGINNERS
# ============================================================
#
# BEFORE YOU RUN:
# 1. Open your project in IntelliJ IDEA.
# 2. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
# 3. Make sure your project has a Python interpreter selected.
#
# HOW TO CHECK YOUR PYTHON INTERPRETER IN INTELLIJ:
# - Go to File -> Project Structure, or Settings/Preferences
# - Look for Python Interpreter / SDK
# - Select a valid Python version
#
# HOW TO RUN THIS FILE:
# - Right-click anywhere in this file
# - Click: Run '01_basics'
# - Or click the green triangle near the top
# - Or use Shift + F10 in many IntelliJ setups
#
# HOW TO RUN ONLY A FEW LINES:
# - Highlight the lines you want
# - Right-click
# - Choose: Execute Selection in Python Console
#
# HOW TO COMMENT / UNCOMMENT CODE:
# - Mac: Cmd + /
# - Windows: Ctrl + /
#
# HOW TO DEBUG:
# - Click in the gutter next to a line number to add a breakpoint
# - Right-click the file
# - Choose Debug
# - Then step through line by line
#
# WHAT __name__ == "__main__" MEANS:
# - Python runs the code inside that block only when this file is run directly.
# - If another file imports this file, the main() function will not run automatically.

# ============================================================
# BEGINNER READING GUIDE
# ============================================================
#
# This section explains a few lines you will see later in the lesson.
# It is placed here on purpose so the lesson code stays clean and easy to follow.
#
# HOW TO READ THIS LINE:
#     print(f"Age: {age} (type: {type(age)})")
#     print(f"Age: {age} (type: {type age)}.format(age, type(age))")

# - This line uses an f-string to print the age and its data type in one line.
#
# BREAKDOWN:
# - print(...) is a built-in Python function that displays output on the screen.
# - The f before the string means this is an "f-string".
# - f-string means "formatted string".
# - An f-string lets Python place variable values inside a string.
# - {age} means: insert the current value of the variable age here.
# - {type(age)} means: run the type(age) function and insert the result here.
# - type(age) tells you what kind of data age is, such as int, str, or float.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# - If age = 63, then the output could look like this:
#     Age: 63 (type: <class 'int'>)
#
# WHY THIS IS USEFUL:
# - It shows both the value and the data type in one line.
# - This helps beginners understand what Python is storing.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO READ THIS LINE:
#     print(f"Height: {height_feet}'{height_inches}\" / {height_meters} m")
#
# BREAKDOWN:
# - This is also an f-string.
# - {height_feet} inserts the feet portion of the height.
# - The single quote ' is used here as the feet symbol.
# - {height_inches} inserts the inches portion of the height.
# - \" tells Python to place a double quote character inside the string.
# - That double quote is used here as the inches symbol.
# - {height_meters} inserts the metric version of the height.
# - The final m means meters.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# - If:
#     height_feet = 5
#     height_inches = 10
#     height_meters = 1.78
# - Then the output would look like:
#     Height: 5'10" / 1.78 m
#
# WHY THE BACKSLASH IS NEEDED:
# - The string itself uses double quotes around the whole sentence.
# - So if you want a double quote character inside the string,
#   you must escape it with a backslash: \"
#
# VISUAL WAY TO THINK ABOUT F-STRINGS:
# - Imagine a sentence with blanks in it:
#     "Age: [blank]"
#     "Height: [blank]'[blank]\" / [blank] m"
# - Python fills in those blanks with the current variable values.
#
# SIMPLE RULE:
# - Text outside { } stays exactly as written.
# - Code inside { } gets evaluated and replaced with its result.
