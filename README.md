## 🎯 The Mission

This is **not** just another collection of code snippets.

This repository is my **personal commitment** to go from solid → excellent → masterful Python developer throughout 2026.

What I'm aiming for by December 31, 2026:

- Deep understanding of Python's philosophy and idioms  
- Clean, readable, maintainable, and performant code  
- Strong command of modern Python (3.10+) features  
- Excellent debugging, testing, and git habits  
- Real-world project portfolio that I'm proud to show  
- The confidence to tackle almost any Python-related problem
